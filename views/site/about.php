                <h2>KERALA POLICE </h2>

                <p>The Kerala Police, like other state police forces in India, is headed by an officer of the rank of Director General of Police (DGP). Most of the senior officers of the force belong to the Indian Police Service (IPS). The IPS is a direct descendant of the Imperial Police of the colonial days. Officers for the IPS are selected through a nation-wide public examination and the annual intake is less than 100 in a nation of over a billion. IPS officers wear the same badges of rank as in the Indian Army. The DGP (and Additional DGPs) are equivalent in rank to a Lt. Gen. in the army, the Inspector General to a Maj. Gen., the Deputy Inspector General to a Brigadier, and so on.
